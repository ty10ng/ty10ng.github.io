# About Me

Welcome to "Tyler's Tech Trek". I'm Tyler, a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) with a broad range of technical interests and skills, extending from current advancements like cloud computing and automation to vintage systems like the Commodore 64.

In my line of work, cybersecurity plays a crucial role. As such, I make an ongoing effort to explore and implement new strategies to enhance system security and protect sensitive data, making a priority of anticipating potential threats.

Efficiency is at the core of my approach to engineering, and automation is a tool I frequently leverage. My objective is to streamline workflows and increase efficiency across the systems and platforms I work with.

I also support the open source software movement, valuing the collaborative environment and continuous learning it offers. Through utilizing and contributing to open source projects, I aim to give back to and engage with the wider tech community.

On this blog, I share my professional insights, discuss projects I'm involved in, and provide commentary on developments in the fields of SRE and cybersecurity. From time to time, I may also reflect on the role of vintage systems in the current tech landscape.

"Tyler's Tech Trek" is a space for professionals, enthusiasts, or anyone interested in the intersection of vintage and modern technology. Whether your interest lies in SRE, cybersecurity, automation, or vintage systems, this blog aims to provide something of value.
